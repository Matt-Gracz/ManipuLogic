# PyLogic
An automated "logic calculator" written in Python.

Currently the project is a proof-of-concept.  It is in its infancy.  I intend to expand it beyond creating basic propositional logic expressions by adding CLI and GUI interaction elements, first and second order logics, automated expression validation, and eventually automated theorem proving.
