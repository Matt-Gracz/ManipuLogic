# ManipuLogic
An automated "logic calculator" written in Python.

Currently the project is a proof-of-concept.  It is in its infancy.  I intend to expand it beyond creating basic propositional logic expressions by adding CLI and GUI interaction elements, first and second order logics, automated expression validation, and eventually automated theorem proving.

Sundry high-level TODO items:
1) Prioritize issues
2) Create feature branches for top-priority issues
3) Upload story-board and design docs
